/**
 * Name of the Game: Creepy Christmas
 * Name of project team: The Dream Team
 * Team Members: Michael Van Buren, Danny Nguyen, Jeremiah Clark, Brenden Worth
 * 
 * Description: You are a slacker elf who over sleeps work one day. As you walk to the workshop, you realize something is wrong - it is a wretched looking candy cane tower. 
 *              Presented with a series of puzzles, riddles, and fights in order to reach the top level of the candy cane tower, you must not only figure out what is wrong but also how to fix it. 
 *              At the final level you discover that Santa himself has turned evil and realize that it is up to you to save Christmas. Can you be the elf that saved Christmas?
 *              
 * Features Added: We have added 5 more rooms along with a special room called Dungeon which has an elevator that can take you to a different floor in the game.
 *                 In the starting room we added 3 objects that dictate how you start the game. Each object has a different action that occurs once you choose to grab that object.
 *                 
 *
